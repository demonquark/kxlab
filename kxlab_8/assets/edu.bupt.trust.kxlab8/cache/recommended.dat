I have resolved the problem, it seems that based on the life cycle 
of both the activity and the fragment by the time the findFragmentById() 
is executed in the onCreate() the fragment has not been 'actually created', 
I tested this by adding a simple button to the layout and making a method that 
when clicked on the button the spinner will be filled with data.
But of course I don't want the user to click a 'Load' button to fill the spinner, 
instead I have implemented on my fragment the public void onActivityCreated() method.
