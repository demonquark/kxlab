Tabs in the action bar make it easy for users to explore and switch between different views in your app. 
The tabs provided by the ActionBar are ideal because they adapt to different screen sizes. 
For example, when the screen is wide enough the tabs appear in the action bar alongside the action buttons
while when on a narrow screen they appear in a separate bar. 
In some cases, the Android system will instead show your tab items as a drop-down list to ensure the best fit in the action bar.
To get started, your layout must include a ViewGroup in which you place each Fragment associated with a tab.
Be sure the ViewGroup has a resource ID so you can reference it from your code and swap the tabs within it. 
Alternatively, if the tab content will fill the activity layout.
then your activity doesn't need a layout at all (you don't even need to call setContentView()). 
Instead, you can place each fragment in the default root view, which you can refer to with the android.R.id.content ID.
